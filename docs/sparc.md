Edit Date & Time: Mike taps on "Edit Message" and changes the scheduled date from March 2nd to March 4th.
Save Changes: He saves the updated schedule.
Confirmation: The app confirms that the changes were saved.
Outcome: The meeting reminder is rescheduled for the new date and time, and Mike can see the updated schedule in the View Scheduled Messages screen.

User Scenario 3: Viewing Status of Scheduled Messages
User: Priya wants to check if her scheduled New Year messages have been sent.

Login: Priya logs into the app and navigates to the "View Scheduled Messages" screen.
Filter Messages: She uses the Filter Options to filter messages by status ‚Äì she selects "Sent".
